# chi-squared-classifier
A simple and elegent classification method for population representation

There are numerous ways to determine if a member of a population is representative of a population. This is an approach using a [Chi-Squared Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_distribution). The samples could things like comparing items sold to one another or whether an elected Congress is representative of the demographics of their constituents in terms of say age or gender (spoilers: they aren't).

Presented here (in the .ipynb file) will be an example comparing the number of items sold by a company compared to opportunities to sell. These opportunities could include number of days an item has been on sale or number of times that item has been presented to a customer. These could be further scaled based on active versus passive sales (a salesperson versus window shopping) or position on a webpage (top of page 1, versus the middle of page 12).
